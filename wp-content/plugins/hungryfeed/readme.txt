== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is HungryFEED? =

HungryFEED is a plugin that includes an RSS feed within the content of a page or post

= 1. The main title and/or description of the feed is displaying, how can I hide that? =

To hide the feed title you can use the feed_items parameter to specify which feed fields you wish to appear like so: feed_items="".  You can use the HungryFEED editor button to help build your shortcode using a GUI.

= 2. I keep getting the verysimple.com feed instead of my own, what's the problem? =

The verysimple feed is used as the default value if no URL is provided, or WordPress can't read the URL parameter due to either a syntax error in the shortcode, or a special character in the feed url.  Here are some known causes:

* Using curly quotes instead of straight quotes (ie ” vs  ")  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark_glyphs
* Certain special characters in the feed url must be url encoded.  Here are some known characters and their replacement:  "=%22 [=%5B  ]=%5D  (see http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp)
* Copy/pasting the URL into the shortcode will sometimes create HTML instead of plain text.  Use the WordPress editor's HTML View to view the raw HTML source code of your post and make sure the URL parameter is plain text and not HTML code

= 3. I'm getting the error that wp-content/cache/ does not exist or is not writeable, what is wrong? =

In order to use caching, you must have a folder in wp-content called "cache" which is writable by the web server.

To do this, first reate an empty folder in /wp-content/ called "cache" if it does not already exist.
Next set permissions of /wp-content/cache/ to 755 or 777 (as necessary on your particular server).
Finally, open /wp.config.php and insert the following code anywhere below existing definitions:
define('ENABLE_CACHE', TRUE);

If you are not able to do create this folder, you can optionally go to Settings->HungryFEED and set the Cache Duration to 0.
However, it is strongly recommended that you do have this directory to enable caching because otherwise Wordpress will make a
new request to the RSS content provider every time any visitor views your page.  This makes your site slower because it
has to retrive the RSS content every time.  It could also be considered bad etiquette to continually hit your
content provider's feed.

= 4. How do I put double quotes into a feed url? =

To put double-quotes into a feed url, enter %22 instead of the double-quote.  This is necessary because the url parameter in the Shortcode is already double-quoted and so you have to use some other character.

= 5. HungryFEED won't read my feed, what do I do? =

First, enter the feed URL in your browser and see if it displays correctly.  If the feed appears to be valid, you may try using some of the debug parameters to investigate.  If you still cannot figure out the problem, you can submit a ticket for support (See the Technical Support section above)

= 6. How can I get a feed to appear in a sidebar widget? =

Shortcodes are not enabled in Widgets by default.  However as of HungryFEED 1.3.9 there is an option to enable Shortcode processing in Widgets on the HungryFEED settings page.  Be aware that this will enable Shortcode for all plugins, not just HungryFEED.  WordPress currently does not support selectively enabling Shortcode for a single plugin, so it is an all-or-nothing option.

= 7. Where do I go for support? =

Documentation is available on the plugin homepage at http://wordpress.org/tags/hungryfeed and questions may be posted on the support forum at http://wordpress.org/tags/hungryfeed
